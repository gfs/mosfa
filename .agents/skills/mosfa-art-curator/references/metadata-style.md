# MoSFA Metadata Style

Use this reference when writing or revising website metadata for `src/data/artworks.yaml`.

Always inspect nearby existing records before editing metadata. Preserve established spellings for eras, categories, and image paths.


## Museum Name Style

Use **MoSFA** as the canonical short-form styling in curator-facing guidance and editorial copy.

- First mention in formal prose: **Museum of Shrimp-Folk Art (MoSFA)**.
- Later mentions: **MoSFA**.
- Keep the full name when legal/institutional clarity is needed.

Avoid legacy all-caps **MOSFA** in new or revised style-guide text unless reproducing historical source material verbatim.

## Required Fields

Each artwork record should include:

```yaml
- title:
  slug:
  artistReference:
  sourceWork:
  yearOrPeriod:
  era:
  categories:
    - 
  image:
  imageAlt:
  summary:
  description:
  featured: false
  published: true
```

`featuredRank` is optional and should only be used for homepage-featured works.

`generation` is optional and private. Use it to keep artwork-generation provenance
with the accession record without exposing it on public pages. Public pages should
only render this field if the prompt history is intentionally part of the artwork.

## Field Guidance

- `title`: Museum-ready title. It may echo the source work and can carry a quiet in-world wink, as with "The Metamoltosis," but should still sound like an accession rather than a joke explained to the visitor.
- `slug`: Lowercase kebab-case, stable, descriptive.
- `artistReference`: Artist, movement, school, or historical style being translated.
- `sourceWork`: Specific source work when relevant, otherwise a movement or study type.
- `yearOrPeriod`: Source date or broad period plus translation context.
- `era`: One museum wing.
- `categories`: Narrower tags. Use existing categories when possible.
- `image`: Public path under `/images/artworks/`.
- `imageAlt`: Plain visual description. Include style and composition. Do not over-explain the concept.
- `summary`: One sentence that makes a curatorial argument.
- `description`: One or two sentences for the detail page. Keep public labels focused on what the work does, not on internal tier language.
- `featured`: Use `true` only when intentionally placing on the homepage.
- `published`: Use `true` for live accessions and `false` for drafts.
- `generation`: Private prompt provenance and iteration history. Prefer `successfulPrompt`, `variations`, and `lessons` so future contributors can reuse what worked without maintaining a separate source of truth.

## Style

Use serious museum language with a little imaginative specificity. Prefer:

- "translation" over "parody."
- "accession" over "upload."
- "shrimp-folk anatomy" over "shrimp person."
- "source structure" over "reference picture."
- "worldbuilding" only when it describes visible cultural logic.

Avoid:

- Food jokes.
- Meme phrasing.
- Claims that overstate quality without evidence.
- Repeating "shrimp-folk" in every sentence.
- Repeating the same summary formula across accessions, especially "A [form] where [elements]..."
- Placeholder title formulas such as "Artist + Shrimp + Form." Prefer a title that could belong to the work inside the collection, with the source relationship carried by `artistReference` and `sourceWork`.
- Treating the work as merely cute or funny.
- Explaining the joke, inversion, or generation premise in public copy. Titles may contain a subtle wink, but summaries and descriptions should stay straight-faced and in universe; if they echo the wink at all, they should do so quietly rather than announcing the premise.
- Public-facing tier labels such as "Gallery Tier" or "Masterpiece Tier." Reserve collection rankings for curatorial review notes unless the user specifically asks to expose them.
- Public-facing process language about generation, regeneration, variants, prompt attempts, image fixes, or replacement history. Website copy should treat the displayed work as the canonical accession unless the artwork itself is explicitly meta-commentary.

## Good Metadata Pattern

```yaml
- title: Shrimp with a Pearl Earring
  slug: shrimp-with-a-pearl-earring
  artistReference: Johannes Vermeer
  sourceWork: Girl with a Pearl Earring
  yearOrPeriod: c. 1665 Dutch Golden Age translation
  era: Baroque & Dramatic Realism
  categories:
    - Dutch Golden Age Portraiture
    - Chiaroscuro Ceremonies
  image: /images/artworks/shrimp-with-a-pearl-earring.jpeg
  imageAlt: A Vermeer-like shrimp-folk portrait with a blue and gold head wrap, dark background, turned gaze, and luminous pearl earring.
  summary: Shell, gaze, cloth, and pearl resolve into one intimate Dutch Golden Age stillness.
  description: The portrait preserves Vermeer's dark ground, turned pose, luminous earring, and hushed psychological presence while translating the sitter into coherent shrimp-folk anatomy.
  featured: true
  featuredRank: 4
  published: true
  generation:
    successfulPrompt: |
      Detailed image-generation prompt that produced the canonical accession.
    variations:
      - result: rejected
        reason: Anatomy became decorative instead of structural.
        prompt: |
          Earlier prompt variation retained for future learning.
    lessons:
      - Name the source composition before adding shrimp-folk details.
      - Preserve museum lighting, material realism, and coherent anatomy.
