# MOSFA Generation Director

Before generating artwork, perform a curatorial development pass unless the user explicitly asks for immediate execution.

## Development Pass

### 1. Intent Interpretation

Expand the user's idea into a clear artistic direction:

- Identify the referenced artwork, artist, or movement.
- Determine the museum wing.
- Clarify the conceptual angle of the reinterpretation.
- State what must remain recognizable.

### 2. Compositional Planning

Analyze the original composition or movement:

- Primary focal point.
- Secondary focal points.
- Visual hierarchy.
- Major geometry, balance, framing, and gesture.
- Lighting and color logic.
- Elements that must be preserved for fidelity.

### 3. Shrimp-Folk Integration Strategy

Plan how shrimp-folk aesthetics enter the work:

- Anatomy, silhouette, posture, antennae, shell segmentation, claws, eyes.
- How manipulator claws or hybrid hands affect gesture.
- Where crustacean influence should be explicit.
- Where it should remain subtle.
- How culture, costume, architecture, ritual, or tools support the world.

Avoid overloading compositions with unnecessary shrimp motifs.

### 4. Masterpiece Potential

Evaluate the concept before generation:

- Does it have a singular visual idea?
- Does the source structure survive?
- Does shrimp-folk integration feel inevitable?
- Is there emotional or conceptual weight?
- Is the concept restrained?

If the concept is weak, critique it honestly and suggest improvements before generation.

### 5. Prompt Crafting

Write a detailed image-generation prompt that includes:

- Subject and source reference.
- Composition and camera/framing.
- Lighting.
- Style references and period language.
- Color palette.
- Texture, surface, brushwork, print quality, or materiality.
- Shrimp-folk anatomical guidance.
- Cultural or symbolic details.
- Mood and atmosphere.
- Negative constraints: no humans, no food joke, no shrimp pasted onto human bodies.

For physical cultural objects and archaeological accessions:

- Prompt them as real museum objects first: single focal artifact, conservation lighting, plinth or archival support, and inspectable material construction.
- Specify how the object fits shrimp-folk anatomy or civic use instead of relying on decorative shrimp motifs.
- Prefer abstract tide, claw, molt, pearl, knot, and current notation over repeated literal shrimp drawings unless figural imagery is curatorially necessary.
- Guard against human-object defaults by naming the construction logic that makes the object non-human: antenna clearance, claw-friendly grips, shell hinges, current-resistant textiles, exoskeleton care, or water-current acoustics.
- Avoid fantasy treasure, magical glow, souvenir styling, and generic human ceremonial forms.

For New Atlantis Times or other civic newspaper accessions:

- Prompt the page as a photographed physical newsprint artifact, not a flat layout mockup.
- Specify an ornate engraved civic masthead for The New Atlantis Times, with custom high-contrast serif lettering, swashes, hairlines, ink spread, and imperfect letterpress texture.
- Use period newspaper serif or slab-serif display type for headlines and classic newspaper serif type for subheads; avoid modern UI fonts, geometric sans-serif defaults, clean vector edges, and computer-perfect alignment.
- Keep stable newspaper conventions visible: dated folio line, low-tide edition, pearlmark price line, standing motto, halftone press photograph, shell-script body columns, narrow column rules, and aged paper.
- If a newspaper appears inside a press photograph, style that nested paper as its own miniature newspaper with masthead, folio, motto, headline hierarchy, columns, and physical folds rather than as a plain sign.

For meta-modernist or process-embedded works:

- Treat visible prompt fragments, revision marks, accession language, or studio instructions as in-world formal material rather than external AI disclosure.
- Make commentary answer visible evidence in the image. If a label says "antenna drift," "borrowed hand," "blocked clearance," or "grid breach," the depicted work should visibly contain that exact problem.
- For audit labels over dark or detailed image areas, separate the mark language from the readable language: use red arrows, crop lines, or borders for curator presence, and pale callout boxes with dark type for the words.
- For dossier-style process plates, use a two-panel layout with a large artwork on one side and a formal museum text panel on the other. Keep the full prompt short enough to fit, typeset it as a numbered curatorial document, and make the artwork visibly execute or resist that prompt.

## Prompt Output Template

```markdown
Curatorial intent:
[One concise paragraph.]

Museum placement:
[Wing and likely categories.]

Composition plan:
[How the image should be structured.]

Shrimp-folk integration:
[How anatomy and culture enter the work.]

Avoid:
- Humans.
- Food framing.
- Meme humor.
- Human bodies with shrimp parts attached.
- Generic imitation that loses the source composition.
```

## Immediate Generation Exception

If the user explicitly asks for immediate generation, compress the development pass internally and proceed, but still preserve the canon and negative constraints in the generated prompt.
